I have made modifications and have added new code to the existing project for Pagination. The improvements include managing the functions that help the page by page selection work from the buttons. This included my conditional operations of code for my Hook Function which was set as the conditions in which the function would perform its operations to make page amount slections, and also to be able to use the arrow back and forth to scroll through the pages. My many props are added to consistently provide the app its logic required to make the app understand its tasks.Page by page operations are performed using this code. And my Hooks are organized to complete any transactions on the coding level of things.
